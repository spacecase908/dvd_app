# Boone Family Mobile Application


## Functional Design Spec
### Author: Andrew Marione

## What is the goal of this project?

In short, to impress my in-laws. The longer story is that my lovely girlfriend's parents have purchased a new house, and the previous owner left behind their extensive DVD collection. In order to ingratiate myself (and hopefully secure invitations to visit), I plan to make an application to help them manage and make the most of their newfound cinematic wealth. 

## Who is my user?

Technically, the whole family would ideally use the application, but the primary users will be the parents (lets call them Bob and Jane). They are an older couple, both with iPhones and a disdain for technology. Bob is comfortable with tech and willing to dig deep to understand it, while Jane at times struggles. 

## What do my users need?

What DVD's do we even have? - User's want to see all their DVDs in one place, browse, and search

Do we have any movies with Stallone? - Users will want to browse their collection through the context of not just attributes like genre, but objects like actors and directors

Ooh lets watch that movie next week! - Users will want to be able to save movies to watch later

I really liked this movie, what else should I watch? - A user will want personalized reccomendations based upon movies they have watched and liked

We just can't decide what to watch - Users will want movies reccomended for them based on their likes and any attributes they want 

Top gun it is!! Wait where do I find it? - Once a movie has been chose, users will need to find the movie in the collection

## So what features do I need to build?
